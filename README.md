# Kaggle Dataset on Breast Cancer

A study of data from the Kaggle breast cancer Wisconsin dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data), looking for patterns, behaviors, and information that may be useful. Throughout the document, different sections can be seen, highlighting the EDA part and the creation and evaluation of models.

The Exploratory Data Analysis part searches for patterns between, relationships, and feature cleaning. The model part creates different model options both with the initial model, as well as with the cleaned model and the application of featuring engineering, to finally obtain metrics.
